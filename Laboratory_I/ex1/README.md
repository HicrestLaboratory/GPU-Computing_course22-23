# Laboratory I: exercise1

You have to follow the directives written in 'lab1.c' by putting your solution code inside the macro with "Put here your code". This exercise has eight small subproblems in which you need to perform a bitwise sum between stack/heap vectors or matrices. For each subproblem, you also have to compute the elapsed CPU time by using the variables ('temp_1', 'temp_2') and storing the result in 'CPU_times\[subproblem_id\]'.

First step: check that by running 'make' and './bin/lab1' the program will return you:

	You are now running YOUR CODE:
	Problem 0 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time
	Problem 1 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time
	Problem 2 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time
	Problem 3 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time
	Problem 4 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time
	Problem 5 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time
	Problem 6 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time
	Problem 7 runs in 0.00000000 CPU time

Start then to write your code.

When the solution will be published, you only need to uncomment lines 30 and 31 for running them.
