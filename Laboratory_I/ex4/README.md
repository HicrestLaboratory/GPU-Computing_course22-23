# Laboratory I: exercise4

Given a vector V := (v_1, … v_n), the prefix sum result is a vector  W := (v_1, v_1+ v_2, v_1 + v_2 + v_3, ... )

Following the same model of the previous exercises (makefile, bin/, src/, batch, ...), write in “Laboratory_I/ex4” an executable which generates a random vector of length 2^n (where n is the input parameter) and then computes the prefix sum.
